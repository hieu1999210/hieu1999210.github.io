Xin chao!

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science, Northeastern University of California Irvine advised by Professor [Huaizu Jiang](https://jianghz.me/). Previously, I graduated from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), majoring in Computer Science.

My research interests are in Deep Learning and Computer Vision focusing on 3D Vision. My goal is to allow machine to reason, understand, and model our 3D world given visual perception. If you'd like to connect, feel free to reach out to me at **nguyen DOT trungh AT northeastern DOT edu**.
