Xin chao!

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science, Northeastern University advised by Professor [Huaizu Jiang](https://jianghz.me/). Currently I interested in 3D Vision including generation, reconstruction, and representation learning. Previously, I spent 3 wonderful years at [VinBigdata](https://vinbigdata.com/en) working on Medical Image Analysis with Dr. [Ha Nguyen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ha-nguyen-a228b5141) and Prof. [Hieu Pham](https://huyhieupham.github.io/)

Research interests:
- 3D representation learning (NeRF, Gaussian Splating, Differential Mesh)
- 3D reconstruction 
- Deep generative models 
- Medical Image Analysis
